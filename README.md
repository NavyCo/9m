9m – Unicode-aware URL Shortener
================================

9m Unicode URL Shortener. Generates a shortcut from <http://9m.no> using two
unicode characters, e.g. <http://9m.no/പ湛>.

The server will choose two characters at random from the all the printable
characters and then cross its finger and hope you use a great font.

(This is a horrible idea in many ways and was a quick hack for fun.)
